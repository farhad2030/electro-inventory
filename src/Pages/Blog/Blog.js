              <b> Ans .</b> JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform,
              interpreted scripting programming language that is primarily used
              for client-side scripting. It's built into both Java and HTML.It
              is generally used on the client-side server. Node js It is
              generally used on the client-side server.
              <br /> <br />
              JavaScript can be run on any engine, including Spider Monkey, V8,
              and JavaScript Core . Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source
              JavaScript runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be run
              on the server. Node.js is a server-side scripting language based
              on the Google Chrome V8 engine. <br /> <br />

              <b> Ans .</b> MongoDB and NodeJS are two different technologies.
              MonogDB is a database system which gives one a chance to
              efficiently store documents in a database and to perform
              operations like data updates, or to search documents by some
              criterias. <b>NodeJS's </b>
              responsibilty is especially to execute your application.

              {" "}
              <b> Ans .</b> SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases
              are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

            <p>
              SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document,

            <p>
              SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL
              is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON

            <p>
              <b> Ans .</b>
              <b> JWT, or JSON Web Token </b>, is an open standard used to share
              security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.
              Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims.
              JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the
              claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
